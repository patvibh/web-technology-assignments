# Exercise 1: Basic HTML5 Webpage

## Question
Create a basic HTML5 webpage that demonstrates the use of:
* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Line breaks
* Horizontal rules
* Text formatting (bold, italic, underline)

## Solution
The solution uses standard HTML5 tags to create a simple webpage with various elements:
* `<h1>` for the main heading
* `<p>` for paragraphs
* `<br>` for line breaks
* `<hr>` for horizontal rules
* Text formatting tags: `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>`

## Output
The webpage displays a heading "Welcome to My Webpage" followed by a paragraph of text. After a line break and horizontal rule, it shows three separate paragraphs demonstrating bold, italic, and underlined text formatting.
